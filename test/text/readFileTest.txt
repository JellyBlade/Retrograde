This is a test of TextHelper's readfile functionality.

The next line should definitely be visible:
I AM VISIBLE!

The next two lines should not appear:
/ I am an RGScript comment.
// I am also an RGScript comment, but I look more like coding comments.

This line should appear, as this is the conclusion of the test.
