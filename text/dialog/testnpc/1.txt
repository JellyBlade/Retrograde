This is Test NPC's dialogue for chapter 1!
:if chapter 2
And also for chapter 2, because Test NPC doesn't have any special dialogue
for this chapter of the game.
Test NPC does, however, have a check for chapter 2 that allows them
to uniquely respond to certain chapters if we don't want to use multiple files
for one-off characters.
