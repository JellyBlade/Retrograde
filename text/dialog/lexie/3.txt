  Lexie: Good luck in the storage room, eh?

  Lexie: Oh hey, you got the storage keycard!

  :pause

  Lexie: Although, you probably won't survive long without a spacesuit, eh?

  :pause

  Lexie: Luckily for you, I managed to snag one from Sarah before she stormed off
  to the Admiral's Quarters.

  :pause

  Lexie: She won't miss this!

  :give spacesuit
  :else

  Lexie: I don't trust Sarah, so I hid the storage keycard from her.
  She hates Tyan with a passion, so I put it somewhere she would never look for
  it.
