Fake NPC: This is my default ask file.
:if chapter 0
  :mc
  [1]: Why default?
  [2]: Why are you Fake?
  :endmcdef
  :1
  Because this is the file I use when I don't have a fallback dialog file to
  use for asking questions.
  :back
  :2
  I am fake because this reality is a lie. We are all here just for the purposes
  of testing someone's code. In fact, once I no longer have any lines to read,
  I will cease to exist, except for brief appearances (like this one) inside
  the output log of a build pipeline.
  :continue
  :endmc
:else
  :mc
  [1]: Woah, why'd the questions change!?
  [2]: What happened!
  :endmcdef
  :1
  Because we're in a new chapter. Even in my default ask file, I can use
  the Command Processor to react to the current game chapter without having to
  create entirely new ask files.
  It's quite handy.
  :2
  The chapter changed. I have new ask dialog without requiring a new file.
  :endmc
:endif
