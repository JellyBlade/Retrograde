Hello!

If you are reading this, something went very wrong.
Somehow, a Log-type object was generated without supplying a proper textPath.
Either that, or someone mistakenly set the path of Log-type object to this file
without realizing that it is not an actual story element.

If you somehow are encountering this during normal gameplay, that means we made
an oopsies somewhere! If you are a bug tester, then great! Please report the
name of the object you just interacted with to us.
If you are not a bug tester... sorry! That's our bad.
