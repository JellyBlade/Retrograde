Welcome to the Retrograde Tech Demo.

The goal of this demo is to test out functionality of room traversal and object
manipulation.

By examining and picking up/dropping objects, you can get a feel for how
interaction with this game will look in the final implementation.

For this demo, it is possible to win by moving the "orb of light" and
"orb of dark" objects found in two of the rooms around (pickup/drop them) in
order to unlock the "gray orb" found in the Steam Room. Picking up the gray orb,
once activated, will complete the game.

Some actions (such as picking up/dropping objects, and moving) will consume
oxygen. After these actions, oxygen will be consumed and each Room will balance
their oxygen levels with their neighbouring rooms.
You can see the current oxygen total with 'status'.
If the average oxygen on the map becomes 0%, you lose.

Use 'help' to get more information about possible actions.

You start in the Pure White Room.
