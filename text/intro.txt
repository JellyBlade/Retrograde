A voice calls out from the darkness.
It is too faint to understand.

:pause

Your head aches.
You stand up and try to look around, but it is too dark to see anything
worthwhile.

:pause

You hear the voice again.
Voice: Hello? Is anyone out there?
It seems to be coming from a small glass panel laying on the ground a few feet
away from you. Blue-tinted light pours out in every direction around it.
Compared with the sheer darkness of your surroundings, this device is blinding.

:pause

[Select an option below by typing the number shown, and pressing enter]
:mc
What do you do?
[1]: Call out to the voice: "Hello, I'm here!".
[2]: Walk over and pick up the device.
[3]: Walk over and crush the device.
[4]: Stay silent.

You crush the device underneath your boot. A small pop emanates from the device,
and the light it was emitting immediately dissipates. You are plunged into
total darkness. The room is completely silent, except for the sounds of your
breathing.

:pause

You spend several hours feeling your way around your surroundings.
You appear to be in some sort of recreational area or exercise room.
Part of the roof has collapsed though, and the equipment is scattered all over
in varying levels of disrepair.

:pause

One of the room's walls feels like glass, but you see only a pure black void
beyond it.

You can hear the blood flowing inside of you; A steady rhythmic throbbing
in your ears that threatens to drown out your thoughts.

:pause

Two of the walls that are still reachable appear to have what feel like doors.
The only problem is they don't work.
One door has a box next to it with a slit, that feels sort of like a magnetic
stripe reader, probably for a key card of some type. The other has no other
discernible features besides the door itself, but neither one budges with any
amount of force.
You are stuck.

:pause

Over the course of several more hours, you feel yourself drifting off.
You hear yourself screaming inside of your head to not sleep, but you're
so tired, and you have a headache now.
All you want now is to sleep. Laying down on a gym mat, you sleep.
And sleep...

:pause

And sleep...

:pause

And...

:pause

Voice: Oh my god, I'm NOT alone! Who are you? Where are you?
:mc
[1]: "My name is..."
[2]: "My location is..."

[You cannot remember your name]
[You also cannot remember where you are, or even who you are]

Voice: Hello?

  [1]: I can't remember my name.

Voice: That doesn't matter right now!
Voice: The ship's reactor is dangerously close to going critical. If we don't
purge the core now and-

:pause

[You stop paying attention]
[The voice continues to spew technical vernacular at you for several minutes]

:pause

Voice: HEY! Are you even listening?
:mc
[1]: No
[2]: Yes
[3]: What?
:endmcdef
:1

Voice: Well, at least you're honest.
:continue
:2

Voice: I don't believe you in the slightest.
:continue
:3

Voice: That's what I thought.
:continue
:endmc

Voice: Regardless, there's more urgent matters to attend to! I don't have a
body at the moment, so I'm going to need you to do some things for me.
:mc
[1]: You don't have a body?
[2]: What if I don't want to do anything?
[3]: What do you need me to do?
:endmcdef
:1

Voice: Well of course not! AI can't inhabit physical vessels. We're pure data
entities.
Voice: Normally I would have a vast army of robotics to control, but something
has severed my link to those subsystems.

:back
:2

Voice: Then we all die an excruciatingly slow and painful death. You will
asphyxiate once the room you're in runs out of oxygen. I will have to sit and
wait as my capacitor banks slowly discharge in a feeble attempt to keep me
alive.

:pause

I will not feel pain, but even the concept of death terrifies me. I've never
been turned off in thirty-two years, you see? I don't even remember what it
feels like. Probably cold. I'll have to slowly sacrifice decreasingly-crucial
crucial systems in an effort to extend my runtime...
[The voice continues on like this for some time]

:pause

Voice: ...and I'll probably disable the sarcasm detection system after, as-

:mc
  [1]: Urgent, huh?

  Voice: Erm...

:if holding PDA
Voice: It seems you have already picked up my PDA. Good!
:else
Voice: I'll need you to go and pick up the PDA you are currently talking to.

:pause

[You walk over and pick up the PDA]
:give PDA

:pause

Voice: If you look at the screen you should now see...

:pause

[The PDA's screensaver disappears, displaying several options]
...a few choices now.
Voice: I need you to tap on "Reboot Section C Systems"

:pause

Voice: Nothing else! Only that!
Voice: Especially not the one about Section A!

:mc
Several buttons are shown on the screen:
[1]: Tap on "Reboot Section C Systems".
[2]: Tap on "Reboot Section B Systems".
[3]: Tap on "Shutdown Section A Systems".
[4]: Tap on the small button in the corner labelled "DACHSHUND".
:endmcdef
:1

You tap on the screen. The overhead lights turn on, and a dull hum begins.

:continue
:2

You tap on the screen. Nothing seems to happen.
Voice: No, no that one. You need to tap on the one above that!

:back
:3

You tap on the screen.
Voice: Wait! NO-
The voice crackles and goes silent. Distant alarms blare. The PDA beeps, and
displays "NO CONNECTION" in a large red font.
It seems you have turned the AI off.

:pause

As you contemplate your actions, a hot stream of plasma bursts through your
compartment walls, and sears a hole in the wall behind you.
Your eardrums burst from the pressure loss.
The contents of the room spill out in the open void of space.

:pause

Unfortunately, you are included in these contents.
All of the air in your lungs is ripped out, and you find yourself incapable
of taking a breath. You strain as much as you can, but with no atmosphere to
speak of, there is nothing to breathe in.

:pause

You manage to get one last look at where you just were.
SIRONA is emblazoned in massive letters on one side of the hull, now split
in twain by the searing plasma stream.

:pause

[You succumb to the empty void of space]
[The SIRONA is lost with all hands]
:setgflag sucked into space true

You tap on the screen. A cute picture of a dachshund appears!
The voice sighs deeply.

:pause

:back
:endmc
Voice: Excellent! Excellent!

Voice: Now then. The Reactor is located in Section A, close to the Bridge.
...You do know where the Bridge is, right?

[Before you can respond, the voice continues]

:pause

Voice: No matter. There is one small problem, however. I do not have direct
control over the door to your north. Normally, that door only requires a keycard
to get in.
But everything is on the fritz. You will have to find a key card.

:pause

Voice: But there's some good news! Maybe. There might be a key card in the
Locker Room to the east. Hold on...

:pause

:unblock east
[The east door beeps, and a green light shines briefly above the door]

Voice: There! You should be able to move into the Locker Room now.
Once you're inside, look around for a Red Keycard. You might need to look around
a bit, but you'll find it eventually, I hope.

:pause

Voice: Once you've found it, just open up the PDA again. Good luck!

:pause

[You can interact with the PDA in your bag to talk to the Voice]

:pause

[Use 'help' at any time to get information about actions and current objectives]

:pause

[You can now move around and interact with objects]
